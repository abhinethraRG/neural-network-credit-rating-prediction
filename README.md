# Neural Network for Credit Rating Prediction

A Python project that applies neural networks to predict credit ratings based on financial and company-related features. The project focuses on preparing real-world data, building a deep learning model, and evaluating how well it predicts risk categories.

## Project Overview

This project builds and evaluates a neural network model to classify credit ratings.  
The workflow covered:

**Data Preparation:** Cleaned, normalized, and split financial data into training and test sets.  
**Neural Network Design:** Built a feedforward neural network with multiple layers and activation functions.  
**Training & Validation:** Tuned hyperparameters and monitored performance across epochs to avoid overfitting.  
**Model Evaluation:** Measured accuracy and confusion matrix results to evaluate predictive strength.  
**Visualization:** Plotted training/validation accuracy and loss to track model learning over time.

## Skills Demonstrated

**Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Designed and implemented a neural network for classification.  
**Data Preprocessing:** Scaled and prepared structured financial data for modeling.  
**Model Tuning:** Experimented with different architectures, epochs, and learning rates.  
**Evaluation Techniques:** Applied accuracy and confusion matrix analysis to interpret results.  
**Python & ML Libraries:** Gained hands-on practice with TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Personal Takeaway

Working on this project helped me connect financial concepts with machine learning in a practical way. I learned how to set up and train a neural network from scratch, handle structured datasets, and evaluate classification performance. More importantly, it gave me confidence in applying deep learning techniques to real-world business problems where accuracy and reliability matter.
